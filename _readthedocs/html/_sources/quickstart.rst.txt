Quick Start
===========

To get started with Social Links API, you need to follow the 3 steps below:

1. Get the API key and a domain: :ref:`support-page-anchor` page.
2. Send a request, replacing ``{...}`` and ``{API Key}`` with your actual domain and API key:

  .. code-block:: bash

     curl 'https://{DOMAIN}/api/stats' -H 'Authorization: {API Key}'

3. If you receive a response with a following structure, it indicates that everything is functioning properly:

  .. code-block:: json

      {
         "plan": "...",
         "expires": "20XX-01-01T00:00:00",
         "throttling": [],
         "points": 100000,
         "message": ""
      }
