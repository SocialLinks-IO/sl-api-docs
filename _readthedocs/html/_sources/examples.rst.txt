Methods Examples
================

.. note::

    To get access to a full list of methods, please, read the :ref:`support-page-anchor` page.

Search in Sources by Alias (≈3000 sites)
----------------------------------------

Users often have the same alias on different platforms. This method, having an alias, finds users on different websites who use the same alias.


In the example above, let’s find pages on different resources that use the alias `elonmusk` by limiting the number of results to `7` (`limit=7`) and the execution time to `110` seconds (`timeout=110`): 


.. code-block:: bash

   # Search for accounts:
   # - with alias "elonmusk"
   # - limit to 7 results
   # - timeout after 110 seconds
   curl 'https://{DOMAIN}/maigret_search?query=elonmusk&limit=7&timeout=110' --header 'Authorization: {API Key}'

SL ISE Search Emails with Similar Password by Email
---------------------------------------------------

The characteristic of a user having similar or identical passwords allows different accounts of the same user to be obtained. This method is used to find other POI's email addresses. By having a POI's email address, you will be able to find other emails that have similar passwords.


In the given example, let’s find e-mail addresses that have similar passwords to the address `alex@gmail.com` and `limit` the number of results in the output to seven by setting the limit parameter equal to `5`:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Search for email addresses that:
   # - have similar passwords to passwords in leak records for alex@gmail.com
   # - limited to 5 results
   curl 'https://{DOMAIN}/emailpass/email_passwords_emails?query=alex%40gmail.com&limit=5' --header 'Authorization: {API Key}'

Twitter Advanced Search Posts
-----------------------------

This method allows you to search Twitter user posts using multiple parameters at once.
It is not necessary to fill in all fields, you can filter by only some parameters (according to the social network's logic).

Take a look at the example on our public GitHub repository as well: `Analyze Social Media Posts <https://github.com/SocialLinks-IO/sociallinks-api?tab=readme-ov-file#analyze-social-media-posts>`_.


This method allows you to search Twitter user's posts by several parameters at once. Let's find posts of account `nytimes` (`query=nytimes`) which contain the words `Syria` or `China` (`these_words=Syria%20China`), in English (`lang=en`), with at least `10` replies (`min_replies=10`), `2` likes (`min_faves=2`), `10` retweets (`min_retweets=10`), and published between `August 25` (`from_date=2024-08-25`) and `December 16` (`to_date=2024-12-16`) of `2024`. We will also sort the result by showing the most latest publications first (`sort=Latest`). Limit the number of results to `5` (`limit=5`) and the response time to `50` seconds (`timeout=50`):

.. code-block:: bash

   # Search for tweets:
   # - containing "nytimes"
   # - with words "Syria" or "China"
   # - in English language
   # - with at least 10 replies
   # - with at least 2 likes
   # - with at least 10 retweets
   # - posted between August 25, 2024 and December 16, 2024
   # - sorted by latest first
   # - limited to 5 results
   # - with 50 second timeout
   curl 'https://{DOMAIN}/twitter_v2/search/tweets?query=nytimes&these_words=Syria%20China&lang=en&min_replies=10&min_faves=2&min_retweets=10&from_date=2024-08-25&to_date=2024-12-16&sort=Latest&limit=5&timeout=50' --header 'Authorization: {API Key}'
